# COSMOS_SOM
This is a working repository for the SOM-based anomaly detection algorithm, developed specifically for detecting unreliable spec-z and photo-z values in COSMOS2015 (Laigle et al. 2016, 2019) catalogue. The description of this work is given in Razim et al. (2020, submitted to MNRAS); a presentation talk given at the IAU ChaICA-2020 conference can be found here: https://youtu.be/AJ1jgz0_jQU. 
This repository, as well as a universal version of the SOM-based in-cell anomaly detection code, is still WIP.
